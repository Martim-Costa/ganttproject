REVIEW DE RODRIGO MESQUITA 57372 - 02/12/2022

This report seems to me to be very good, you made it easy to understand by going straight to the point
and giving good examples with graphs and math functions.
I also liked the way you concluded the report with the example of several possible cases of a code smell.
